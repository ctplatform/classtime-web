Our project also require using Node.js to run. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript 
runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, 
which was designed to build scalable network applications. It is used for server-side programming, and primarily 
deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, 
but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version 
of a JS engine, and node.
 
The installation of Node.js is very simple. Go to
https://nodejs.org/en/
and there will be different options for different operating systems


After we finished installing the Node.js, we could try to build a really simply web server. 
For example, using the codes below:

const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});

and run it using the command 

node app.js

Then bisit http://localhost:3000 will generate a message saying "Hello World".
