Our project also require using Node.js to run. Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript 
runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, 
which was designed to build scalable network applications. It is used for server-side programming, and primarily 
deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services, 
but was originally designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind. Every browser has its own version 
of a JS engine, and node.
 
The installation of Node.js is very simple. Go to
https://nodejs.org/en/
and there will be different options for different operating systems
