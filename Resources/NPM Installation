Any project that's using Node.js will need to have a package.json file. A package.json file can be described as a 
manifest of your project that includes the packages and applications it depends on, information about its unique 
source control, and specific metadata like the project's name, description, and author.
A package.json file usually contains datas with project's name, version, description, license, and keywords.

Downloading NPM only needs one command line:
npm install -g npm

We could also use Node installer, with running
-o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

And then, using 
node -v
npm -v
can check the installed version, if we have node.js installed as well. 

Then, using npm init command is a step-by-step tool to scaffold out your project. 
It will prompt you for input for a few aspects of the project as mentioned above. 

using
npm install <module>
can installing modules from npm
